# Breast Cancer Classification Using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project demonstrates a binary classification task to predict breast cancer diagnosis (malignant or benign) using logistic regression. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn is utilized to build and evaluate a predictive model, showcasing fundamental machine learning processes such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Motivation
Early and accurate detection of breast cancer significantly impacts treatment success rates. Logistic regression provides an interpretable and effective method for medical diagnosis tasks, making it suitable for this classification problem.

## Dataset
- Source: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (scikit-learn)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)
- Samples: 569
- Features: 30 real-valued attributes derived from digitized images of breast masses
- Target: Binary classification (0 = malignant, 1 = benign)

## Features
- Data loading and exploration
- Train-test split and feature scaling (standardization)
- Logistic regression model training and prediction
- Model evaluation using accuracy score and ROC curve with AUC metric
- Visualization of the decision boundary using the first two features for interpretability

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-logistic-regression.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd breast-cancer-logistic-regression
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) or script in your environment and run the cells sequentially.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Results
- High accuracy achieved on test data
- ROC curve visualization demonstrating strong classification performance
- Decision boundary plot illustrating class separation in feature space
